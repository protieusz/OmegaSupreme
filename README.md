# OmegaSupreme
RP2040 integrated components with integrated PMW3360 trackball sensor &amp; PER56 encoder. The RP2040 pins are fully broken out into either pads or ribbon connections. Design this for convienience and easier to design a keyboard pcb around the OmegaSupreme itself.
Current on print by JLCPCB. Cost is a little bit on the pricey side. Around $89 CAD with shipping included. SK6812 mini e was omitted from the assembly to keep the cost down.  Part of the reason behind being pricey was the use of 3 extended parts i.e. 2 ribbon connectors and 1 JSH connector. Gerber files will be posted once I tested it. As always print at your "OWN RISK".  I do not offer support. You can feel free to modify it as long as you credit me. Thanks.
